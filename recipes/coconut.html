    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup long-grain white rice</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups coconut milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons sugar (optional, for sweetness)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded coconut (optional, for added texture and flavor)</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro or chopped green onions for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Steps</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix the coconut milk and water. If the coconut milk is thick, you can dilute it with a bit more water.</li>
        <li>In a saucepan or rice cooker, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the rinsed rice and saut√© for 1-2 minutes until the rice is lightly toasted.</li>
        <li>Pour the coconut milk and water mixture into the saucepan with the rice.</li>
        <li>Add salt and sugar (if using). Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer. Allow it to cook for about 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is tender and has absorbed the liquid.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork to separate the grains.</li>
        <li>If you're using shredded coconut for added texture, you can toast it in a dry skillet over medium heat until golden brown. Sprinkle the toasted coconut over the cooked rice.</li>
        <li>Garnish the coconut rice with fresh cilantro or chopped green onions for added flavor and freshness.</li>

    </ol>
