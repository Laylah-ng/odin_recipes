    <ol>
        <li>Chop the onion, dice the tomatoes and bell peppers, and mince the garlic</li>
        <li>In a large pot or a deep skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add chopped onions and minced garlic to the hot oil. Saut√© until the onions are translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the blended or diced tomatoes and red bell pepper to the pot. Cook for about 5-7 minutes,
             stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens.</li>
        <li>Add ground ginger, thyme, bay leaves, salt, and pepper to the tomato and pepper mixture. 
            Stir well to combine.</li>
        <li>Pour in the rinsed rice and stir until it is well-coated with the tomato and spice mixture</li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low.Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid 
            and let it simmer for 20-25 minutes or until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
        <li>If you're adding protein (chicken, fish, shrimp, etc.), you can place it on top of the rice about 10-15 minutes before the rice is done. This allows the protein to cook along with the rice.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork to separate the grains.</li>
        <li>Serve the Jollof rice hot, garnished with diced green bell peppers for extra freshness.
