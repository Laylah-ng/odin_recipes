    <p>Steps</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ensure that your cooked rice is cooled and not too sticky. It's ideal to use leftover rice that has been refrigerated.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add chopped onions and minced garlic. Stir-fry for 1-2 minutes until the onions are translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the mixed vegetables to the skillet and continue to stir-fry for an additional 3-4 minutes until the vegetables are tender-crisp.</li>
        <li>Push the vegetables to one side of the skillet, creating an empty space.</li>
        <li>Pour the beaten eggs into the empty space. Allow them to set for a moment and then scramble them with a spatula until cooked through.</li>
        <li>Mix the scrambled eggs with the vegetables in the skillet.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked and cooled rice to the skillet. Use a spatula to break up any clumps of rice and evenly distribute it among the vegetables and eggs.</li>
        <li>Drizzle soy sauce and oyster sauce over the rice mixture. Stir well to combine and evenly distribute the sauces.</li>
        <li>Drizzle sesame oil over the fried rice and stir to incorporate.</li>
        <li>Taste the fried rice and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.</li>
        <li>Garnish the fried rice with chopped green onions for freshness.</li>
        <li>Serve the fried rice hot as a main dish or as a side dish. It pairs well with your favorite protein, such as chicken, shrimp, or tofu.</li>
